# LTSort

*With inspiration from https://github.com/eknkc/tsort
and http://stackoverflow.com/a/5100904*

## Rationale

I needed a way to resolve dependencies, that is, to do a so-called topological
sort, so I copied code from https://github.com/eknkc/tsort and modified it for
my needs. Later I realized that doing a levelled (a.k.a. grouped) toposort
would be very  desirable, but I couldn't find any JavaScript / NodeJS module
to do just that.  I implemented the ideas given in
http://stackoverflow.com/a/5100904, and added tests and documentation.

## Example

Creating a graph and populating it with nodes and edges; the node labels
appear in natural order (`LTSORT.add g, a, b` meaning that `b` depends on `a` having
been done first):

```coffee
LTSORT = require 'ltsort'

graph = LTSORT.new_graph loners: no

LTSORT.add graph, 'buy books',         'do some reading'
LTSORT.add graph, 'buy books',         'go home'
LTSORT.add graph, 'buy food',          'cook'
LTSORT.add graph, 'buy food',          'go home'
LTSORT.add graph, 'buy food',          'have a coffee'
LTSORT.add graph, 'cook',              'eat'
LTSORT.add graph, 'do some reading',   'go to exam'
LTSORT.add graph, 'eat',               'do some reading'
LTSORT.add graph, 'eat',               'go to exam'
LTSORT.add graph, 'fetch money',       'buy books'
LTSORT.add graph, 'fetch money',       'buy food'
LTSORT.add graph, 'go home',           'cook'
LTSORT.add graph, 'go to bank',        'fetch money'
LTSORT.add graph, 'have a coffee',     'go home'

tasks = LTSORT.group graph
```

`tasks` is now a list of lists:

```coffee
[ [ 'go to bank' ],
  [ 'fetch money' ],
  [ 'buy books', 'buy food' ],
  [ 'have a coffee' ],
  [ 'go home' ],
  [ 'cook' ],
  [ 'eat' ],
  [ 'do some reading' ],
  [ 'go to exam' ] ]
```

which tells me that I'd have to cook before you eat, that I can only buy foods
and books with some money on my hands, but that buying foods and books can happen in
any order, and so on.

## API

### Creation

#### `@new_graph settings`

Create a new graph object. `settings`, if used, may be an object containing a single named
item `loners`, which should be `true` or `false`; it is only relevant for
`LTSORT.find_root_nodes` and `LTSORT.group`, for which see below. Alternatively, `settings`
may be a graph itself, in which case a copy of that graph will be returned.

### Population

#### `@add graph, lhs, relation = null, rhs = null`

Add a node or an edge to the graph. Possible forms are:

* `LTSORT.add graph, 'A'`—add a node labelled `A` to the graph.

* `LTSORT.add graph, 'A', 'B'`—add an edge to the graph that states that node `A`
  must precede node `B`. `A` and `B` will be added implicitly if not already present in the graph.

#### `@populate graph, elements`

Add all `elements` to the `graph`. `elements` should be a list of strings
and pairs of strings; single strings will be registered as nodes and pairs
of strings will be interpreted as precedent/consequent pairs. For example:

```coffee
graph     = LTSORT.new_graph()
elements  = [
  [ 'A', 'X', ]
  [ 'B', 'X', ]
  'F'
  [ 'X', 'Y', ]
  [ 'X', 'Z', ]
  ]
LTSORT.populate graph, elements
```

### Deletion

#### `@delete graph, name`

Remove the node identified by `name` from `graph`. Currently, only nodes
that have no precedents (i.e. root nodes, including unconnected ('lone') nodes)
may be deleted. This is used by `LTSORT.group`, below.

### Retrieval

#### `@has_node graph, name`

Return whether `graph` has a node labelled with `name`.

#### `@has_nodes graph`

Return whether `graph` has any nodes at all.


#### `@is_lone_node graph, name`

Return whether the node labelled `name` is a 'lone' node (i.e. one without precedents
and without consequents; a node that is not part of any edge). Will throw an error
if `graph` doesn't have a node labelled `name`.

#### `@find_lone_nodes graph, root_nodes = null`

Return a list of all lone nodes in the graph.

#### `@find_root_nodes graph, loners = null`

Return a list of all root nodes in the graph (i.e. those nodes that have no precedents /
depend on nothing else in the graph). If `loners` is given and true, that list will
include lone nodes; if it is given and false, that list will exclude lone nodes. If
`loners` is not given, the graph's `loners` property will be used instead.

### Sorting

#### `@get_linearity graph`

Linearity of a given dependency graph measures how well the dependency relations in a graph determine an
ordering of its nodes. For a graph that defines a unique, single chain of antecedents and consequents,
linearity will be 1; for a graph that defines only nodes and no dependency edges, linearity will be zero;
for all other kind of graphs, linearity will be close to the inverse of the average group length.

Linerarity is directly related to how many groups (of mutually independent nodes) there are in the graph
and how many nodes they contain; for example, here are the results of the `LTSORT.group graph` method and
the respective linearity values:

```coffee
[ [ 'A', 'B', 'C' ] ]
0
```

```coffee
[ [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' ] ]
0
```

```coffee
[ [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' ], [ 'E' ] ]
0.25
```

```coffee
[ [ 'A' ], [ 'B' ], [ 'C' ] ]
1
```

#### `@linearize graph`

Return a list with node labels, ordered such that all consequents come after their
precedents. In other words, in a graph where edges represent dependencies and
where a given task `y` depends on task `x` having been finished, its
linearization will spell out one way in which to perform actions such that all
prerequisites `x` come before any of their dependent tasks `y`. For example:

```coffee
graph     = LTSORT.new_graph()
elements  = [
  [ 'A', 'X', ]
  [ 'B', 'X', ]
  'F'
  [ 'X', 'Y', ]
  [ 'X', 'Z', ]
  [ 'δ', 'B', ]
  [ 'Z', 'Ψ', ]
  [ 'Ψ', 'Ω', ]
  [ 'Z', 'Ω', ]
  [ 'β', 'A', ]
  [ 'α', 'β', ]
  ]
LTSORT.populate graph, elements
tasks = LTSORT.linearize graph
```

`tasks` now equals

```coffee
[ 'α', 'β', 'A', 'δ', 'B', 'X', 'F', 'Y', 'Z', 'Ψ', 'Ω' ]
```

(although the exact placement of some nodes such as `F` is not guaranteed). Going
through the precedence rules given, we can ascertain this result is 'sufficiently
good' to base a step-by-step procedure upon:

* `α ⇒ β` was specified, and, indeed, `α` comes before `β` in the linearization.
* `A ⇒ X` and `B ⇒ X` were specified, and, indeed, both `A` and `B` come before `X`.
* Both `Z` and `Y` depend on `X`, and they indeed come after `X`.
* `δ ⇒ B ⇒ X` was specified, and, indeed, `δ`, `B` and `X` appear in that order.
* &c.

#### `@group graph, loners = null`

Like `LTSORT.linearize`, but return a list of lists instead. Using the same
setup as shown above, but using `LTSORT.group` instead of `LTSORT.linearize`:

```coffee
  tasks = LTSORT.group graph
```

we get:

```coffee
  [ [ 'F' ],
    [ 'δ', 'α' ],
    [ 'B', 'β' ],
    [ 'A' ],
    [ 'X' ],
    [ 'Y', 'Z' ],
    [ 'Ψ' ],
    [ 'Ω' ] ]
```

Each element in the list represents a number of steps that may be performed in
any order or in parallel (i.e. tasks that are independent of each other). Here
we have created the graph with an (implicit) setting `loners: true`, which
causes lone tasks to be singled out as the first (possibly empty) list; had we
created the graph with `loners: false` (or called `LTSORT.group graph,
false`), the first group of tasks would have become `[ 'F', 'δ', 'α' ]`.

Observe that **(1)** the ordering of nodes within each group is not defined;
it may or may not change when nodes and edges are added in a different order;
**(2)** tasks appear as soon as possible in the listing, meaning that there's
a chance that a given task could be accomplished later than indicated here. As
with `LTSORT.linearize`, the result given is just one possible solution to
the constraints given, and not necessarily the only one.



# To Do

* **[–]** modernize
* **[–]** rewrite as class
* **[–]** should we support anything but strings as keys?
* **[–]** use more explicit `cfg` (named keys) API
* **[–]** support symbolic `*` star to mean 'before, after any other', as implemented in
  `hengist/dev/intertext-lexer/src/test-toposort.coffee` (2023-01-22):
